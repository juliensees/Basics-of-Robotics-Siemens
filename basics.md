- Classification of handling facilities
  * Controlled manually
      - person controlled manipulators for moving very heavy or very small objects (micromanipulators), or dangerous environments (teleoperators)
  * Program controlled
      - Inserting devices
        - fixed programmed: mechanically adjustable and travel limit
            - used for point-to-point movements, and feeding components
            - movement limitation via stops, sensors or limit switches
      - Freely programmable
          - high mobility with at least three axes
          - used for welding, gluing, grinding, painting, etc.
          - partly sensor-guided
        - computer-controlled: by CNC or PLC

### PLC - A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an electronic module that is used in automation technology for control and regulation tasks. In principle, it is a control device with specialized input and output interfaces for sensors and actuators. A PLC can thus control, monitor and influence production processes.

### PLM - Product Lifecycle management - a process of product management from design to discontinuation to maximize the business benefits fror the company and its business partners. Everything from idea generation, design, engineering, manufacturing process management, product portfolio management, and supply chain functions for product realization

### TIA Portal - Totally Integrated Automation Portal - provides complete access to the tnire digitzed automation from digital planning and integrated engineering to transparent operation. It serves as a common engineering tool for robots and machines. 

ROS - Robot Operating System is an open source system that then companies build software on top of that is often closed source

### The robot is made up of the socket (base), the joints, the end effector, and the arm 

  * End effector - the last piece on the robot arm that corresponds to its selected task
  * Robot Arm
      - drives: energy converters located in the base or axis, that are motors that set the arm in motion and can be electric or hydraulic
      - joints and gears: ensure the accuracy and reliability (very precise)
      - measuring systems: measure and record all positions and speeds at each drive or joint
      - sensors: touch or optical sensors that allow the robot to interact with objects and provide safety (someone or something comes too close)
      - mechanical holding brakes that prevent movement dur to safety of a power failure
   
### the workspace - the possible movement range of a robot

Repeatability - a robot never actually repeats the same task in the actual exact position. it is usually off by microns, and so the repeatable accuracy is always a specific number that is determined with each robot to see how accurate it can be
